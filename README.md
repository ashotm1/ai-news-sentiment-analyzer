# AI Market Signal

Event-driven trading signal pipeline for small-cap stocks. Detects and classifies SEC 8-K press releases, extracts structured features via LLM, and pairs them with intraday price reactions for ML training.

Scope is non-earnings catalyst events — M&A, clinical readouts, crypto treasury, collaborations, contracts, product launches, etc.

> **Status:** Data pipeline and LLM feature extraction are in progress. ML model training and signal prediction are not yet implemented.

## Data Pipeline

Downloads EDGAR 8-K filings, identifies press releases, classifies them by catalyst type, extracts structured LLM features, and fetches corresponding intraday price data from Polygon.

Classification works in two passes — a fast regex pass on the PR title, followed by an optional LLM batch pass for anything the regex didn't catch. Signal catalysts: `clinical`, `private_placement`, `collaboration`, `m&a`, `new_product`, `contract`, `crypto_treasury`.

```bash
python pipeline.py --days 30 --llm --prices
```

## Live Sentiment UI *(demo)*

Quick headline sentiment demo — scrapes stock headlines and runs sentiment on titles. Separate from the main pipeline.

- **Models**: FinBERT (local), GPT-4o Mini, Claude Haiku
- Stack: FastAPI + Flask + simple UI

## Requirements

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — LLM classification + feature extraction
- `MASSIVE_API_KEY` or `POLYGON_API_KEY` — Polygon.io price data
- `SEC_USER_AGENT` — SEC EDGAR fair-access policy (e.g. `"Name email@example.com"`)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — only if using GPT model in UI
